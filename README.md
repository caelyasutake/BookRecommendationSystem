# BookRecommendationSystem

Book recommendation system using data from Goodreads. The system implements collaborative filtering and a user similarity matrix to recommend books other users liked.

The recommendation system takes in book titles and interaction data via Goodreads. The user then provides information about which books the user likes and the program subsequently outputs recommendations based on other users. This system can be combined with other recommendation systems to create a more comprehensive list of recommendations.
